The Plug.dj bot for [Coding Soundtrack Lounge](http://plug.dj/coding-soundtrack-lounge/) that runs on Node.js

After cloning, run "npm install" to get all the dependancies.

You'll also need to clone the plug-api* into "lib" folder.

*DO NOT INSTALL PLUG API THROUGH NPM; IT'S OUT OF DATE*

Copy appTemplate.js, create a new file and add your bots info and room info. This is the file that you will run.
After you have your app.js file setup, go ahead and start it up on a node server. (from CLI in the root of the bot run "node app.js")

If you frequent the room feel free to send me a pull request.
Have fun!
