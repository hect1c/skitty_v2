Plug.dj bot for Coding Soundtrack Lounge


Runs on Node.js

After downloading, you need to run "npm install" to get all the dependancies.

You'll also need to download the plug-api* and add it to the folder in "lib" that shares its name.
*DO NOT INSTALL PLUG API THROUGH NPM; IT'S OUT OF DATE*

Copy appTemplate.js, create a new file and add your bots info and room info. This is the file that you will run.
After you have your app.js file setup, go ahead and start it up on a node server. (from CLI in the root of the bot run "node app.js")
